<p> Myth: From the time they start school, most girls are less interested in science than boys are.</p>

<p>Reality: In elementary school about as many girls as boys have positive attitudes toward science.</p>

<p>In math, the girls outscored the boys in the exam graded anonymously, but the boys outscored the girls when graded by teachers who knew their names. The effect was not the same for tests on other subjects, like English</p>

<p>According to the Harvard Business Review, 41% of women working in tech eventually end up leaving the field (compared to just 17% of men) [â€¦]</p>

<p>Because of the high attrition rate for women working in tech, teaching more girls and women to code is not enough to solve this problem.</p>

<br>


<p>Loss of women in tech happens with drop offs during CS courses &amp; majors in college and then also out in the tech workforce because itâ€™s a toxic and imbalanced place for them to spend their time and energy.</p>

<p>All this money thrown at adorable girls, creating projects for them will not help if they are being set up just to go into that existing environment.</p>

<p>The majority of VCs donâ€™t know how to code but have financial or business backgrounds, yet only 4.2% of US partner-level VCs are female. And still, VCs blame the absence of female board members on the lack of women graduating from engineering programs.</p>

<p>new research of which I am the coauthor shows this pervasive leaky pipeline metaphor is wrong for nearly all postsecondary pathways in science and engineering</p>

<p>Should we be encouraging women to get into the pipeline when we know the pipeline leads to a sewage treatment plant?</p>
